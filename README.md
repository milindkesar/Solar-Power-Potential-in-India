# Solar Power Potential Estimation in India
 

Objective

We aim to identify the potential regions in India for setting up solar power plants considering several features. Also, we aim to correlate the production of one plant with different seasons and generalize this to identify the ideal production conditions.

 

Background

The demand for renewable energy is increasing continuously and solar energy plays a major role in this. It is important to analyze the current production capacity and identify the areas requiring development and increase the production as much as possible. 

 

Potential Applications

Can be used to identify the regions requiring development in India with respect to solar energy production.

Can be used to find the ideal conditions for setting up a solar power plant.

 

Approach

We plan to predict whether a region has the potential for setting up a solar plant by using the existing data containing the list of solar power plants and the various attributes which are correlated with the solar plants to train a model and use that model to predict if any given region has the potential to set up a plant or not.

Using the hour to hour production dataset of a few plants, we plan to create a timeseries model to predict the potential production using the past data and correlate this data with weather, seasons etc to identify ideal production conditions.
