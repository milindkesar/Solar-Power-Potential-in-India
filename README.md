# Solar Power Potential Estimation in India
 

Objective

We aim to identify the potential regions in India for setting up solar power plants considering several features. Also, we aim to correlate the production of one plant with different seasons and generalize this to identify the ideal production conditions.

 

Background

The demand for renewable energy is increasing continuously and solar energy plays a major role in this. It is important to analyze the current production capacity and identify the areas requiring development and increase the production as much as possible. 

 

Potential Applications

Can be used to identify the regions requiring development in India with respect to solar energy production.

Can be used to find the ideal conditions for setting up a solar power plant.
